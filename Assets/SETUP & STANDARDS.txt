# Setup and Standards Doc
The purpose of this short doc is to get us all on the same page regarding a few important things such as world scale, layers, prefab setups, etc.

## World Scale & Origin
We will be using Unity's default 1 m = 1 Unity Unit. Note animations don't scale well.
Y=100m is the deepest water bottom. Position terrains at Y=-100, and flatten land to +100.

## Folder Organizing
-Game folder is used by the designer & artist to store the models, assets & prefabs of the game.
-Scripts folder is used by programmers to store scripts.
-Audio folder is used by the sound engineer to store the audio & musics of the game.
-Scenes folder is used to store everything related to scenes & terrains (not environment assets).
